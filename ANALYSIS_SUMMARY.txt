SSH REMOTE TERMINAL STREAMING ARCHITECTURE ANALYSIS - SUMMARY
================================================================================

Based on thorough examination of Claude Code (Swarm IDE implementation):

KEY FINDINGS:
=============

1. SSH SERVER DEPLOYMENT & MANAGEMENT
   - Uses node-ssh library for connection management
   - Implements connection pooling with state machine
   - Automatic server bootstrap via SFTP file transfer
   - Smart checks: server running, Node.js installed, dependencies
   - Health monitoring via 30-second heartbeat pings
   - Exponential backoff reconnection strategy

2. TERMINAL MANAGEMENT ARCHITECTURE
   - node-pty for PTY process creation on remote
   - Critical: Login shell with proper environment (TERM, LANG, HOME, USER)
   - Multi-client handler pattern: one PTY broadcasts to many WebSocket clients
   - Workspace-aware: each workspace has independent terminal directory context
   - Proper cleanup on disconnect (no orphaned processes)

3. WEBSOCKET STREAMING
   - JSON message protocol for input/output/resize/exit
   - Bidirectional: client→server for input, server→client for output
   - Message format: {type: 'data'|'input'|'resize'|'exit', ...}
   - Ready-state checking before sends (avoid EPIPE errors)
   - Graceful terminal exit signaling with exit code + signal

4. CLIENT-SIDE RENDERING
   - xterm.js with FitAddon, WebLinksAddon, optionally WebGLAddon
   - CRITICAL: Exact initialization order to prevent race conditions
   - Data buffering pattern: accumulates output until terminal ready
   - Multiple timing delays: 200ms for DOM settle, 100ms between fits
   - ResizeObserver for responsive terminal sizing

5. COMMUNICATION ARCHITECTURE
   - Electron IPC proxy pattern (main process acts as WebSocket gateway)
   - Reason: Renderer CSP policy restricts direct WebSocket to localhost
   - Main process maintains WebSocket connections, forwards via IPC
   - Fallback chain: try server → SSH direct → local (with automatic selection)

6. CRITICAL PATTERNS TO IMPLEMENT
   - Connection State Machine: prevent operations on disconnected state
   - Lazy Connection: create config before connecting
   - Multi-Client Broadcasting: array of handlers, not re-attaching PTY
   - Data Buffering: buffer output during initialization
   - IPC Proxy: use main process as WebSocket gateway
   - Port Forwarding: SSH tunnel for remote server access
   - Environment Setup: complete shell environment including TERM, LANG

ARCHITECTURAL LAYERS:
====================

1. SSH Layer
   - Connection pooling, authentication, command execution
   - File transfer via SFTP
   - Health monitoring & auto-reconnect

2. Deployment Layer
   - Automatic detection of server status
   - Upload via SFTP (skip node_modules, .git)
   - npm dependency installation
   - Server startup with nohup background execution

3. Server Layer (swarm-server)
   - Express.js HTTP API
   - WebSocket.Server for streaming
   - Workspace manager (directory context)
   - Terminal manager (PTY lifecycle)
   - Auto-shutdown on idle (resource cleanup)

4. WebSocket Layer
   - JSON message protocol
   - Bidirectional input/output
   - Terminal resize signaling
   - Exit code notification

5. IPC Layer
   - Electron main process proxy
   - CSP-compliant communication
   - Message forwarding between renderer and remote

6. Client Layer
   - xterm.js terminal emulator
   - Data buffering during initialization
   - Multi-terminal panel management
   - Responsive sizing with ResizeObserver

DATA FLOW:
==========

User Types
  → xterm.js onData event
  → window.electronAPI.terminalWrite() IPC call
  → Main process receives, forwards to WebSocket
  → swarm-server receives, writes to PTY
  → Shell receives and processes

PTY outputs
  → ptyProcess.onData() callback fires
  → Broadcast to all client handlers
  → Each handler sends via WebSocket
  → Main process receives and sends IPC to renderer
  → Renderer's Terminal.onData() callback triggers
  → xterm.js.write() renders output

CRITICAL TIMING DETAILS:
=======================

- SSH connection timeout: 20 seconds
- Heartbeat check interval: 30 seconds
- Data buffering timeout: 3 seconds
- DOM settle delay: 200 milliseconds
- Terminal fit delay: 100 milliseconds
- Server startup check delay: 2 seconds
- Idle shutdown check interval: 60 seconds
- Default idle timeout before shutdown: 30 minutes

IMPLEMENTATION HIGHLIGHTS:
==========================

1. Automatic Server Deployment
   - No manual setup required on remote
   - Detects if already running, skips installation
   - Uploads only necessary files (efficient)
   - Installs npm dependencies in production mode

2. Multi-Client Support
   - Single PTY shared by multiple WebSocket clients
   - Each client has independent output handler
   - Allows terminal recovery after client disconnect
   - Terminal persists while any client connected

3. Robust Error Handling
   - Connection state machine prevents invalid operations
   - Exponential backoff reconnection (up to 30s delay)
   - WebSocket ready-state checking before sends
   - Handler exceptions logged but don't crash server

4. Resource Cleanup
   - Auto-shutdown on idle (configurable timeout)
   - Terminal graceful exit handling
   - WebSocket cleanup on disconnect
   - No orphaned processes on server

FILES TO STUDY:
===============

Essential:
  1. /src/services/SSHConnectionManager.js (connection pooling)
  2. /src/services/SwarmServerDeployer.js (server bootstrap)
  3. /src/services/SwarmServerManager.js (server API wrapper)
  4. /src/components/terminal/Terminal.js (xterm.js wrapper)
  5. /swarm-server/src/server.js (HTTP + WebSocket server)
  6. /swarm-server/src/terminal-manager.js (PTY management)
  7. /main.js (IPC handlers for WebSocket proxy)

Supporting:
  - /src/components/terminal/TerminalPanel.js (multi-terminal UI)
  - /swarm-server/src/workspace-manager.js (directory context)
  - /swarm-server/src/index.js (server entry point)

KEY ALGORITHMS:
===============

1. Connection State Transitions
   DISCONNECTED → CONNECTING → CONNECTED
                  ↓            ↑
                  └─ ERROR ←───┘
                     ↓
                  RECONNECTING

2. Server Deployment Sequence
   Check if running
     → Yes: Done
     → No: Check Node.js
       → No: Fail
       → Yes: Check if installed
         → Yes: Start server
         → No: Upload + npm install + start

3. Terminal Data Routing
   One PTY process
     → On data event, iterate handlers array
       → Each handler is independent WebSocket send
         → Can have failures without affecting others

4. Client Data Buffering
   During init: _isBufferingData = true
     → All incoming data buffered
   After ready: flushDataBuffer()
     → Write all buffered data at once
     → Set _isBufferingData = false

SECURITY PATTERNS:
==================

1. SSH Private Keys
   - Loaded from user config, never stored
   - Passphrase support for encrypted keys
   - Algorithm negotiation (kex, cipher, hmac)

2. WebSocket Over Tunnel
   - No direct internet exposure
   - SSH tunnel provides encryption + authentication
   - localhost-only access (no network listening)

3. Server Resource Limits
   - Auto-shutdown on idle
   - Terminal process killing on exit
   - No indefinite connections

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:
==========================

1. Connection Pooling
   - Reuse SSH connections for multiple operations
   - Avoid repeated authentication

2. SFTP Optimization
   - Skip large directories (node_modules)
   - Use fastPut for efficient file transfer

3. Terminal Rendering
   - WebGL addon for hardware acceleration
   - Canvas fallback if WebGL unavailable
   - ResizeObserver debounced at 100ms

4. Message Batching
   - PTY output may contain multiple events
   - All handled in single onData callback

NEXT STEPS FOR IMPLEMENTATION:
=============================

1. Understand connection state machine
   - Study SSHConnectionManager.js
   - Trace state transitions through lifecycle

2. Trace deployment flow
   - Follow SwarmServerDeployer.ensureServerRunning()
   - Note SFTP upload and npm install steps

3. Study message protocol

CONCLUSION:
===========

This is a sophisticated, production-ready architecture for remote IDE terminal
support. Key innovations include:

1. Automatic server bootstrap (no manual setup)
2. Multi-client handler broadcasting (terminal sharing)
3. Proper race condition handling (data buffering)
4. Robust error recovery (exponential backoff)
5. Resource cleanup (auto-shutdown on idle)
6. Clean fallback chain (graceful degradation)

The implementation demonstrates best practices for remote terminal streaming
in distributed development environments.
