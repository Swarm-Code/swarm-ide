## üîç Known Issues

1. **Push/Pull Not Working**: The UI is implemented but the actual git operations fail. Need to debug the backend integration.
2. **No Conflict Resolution UI**: Merge conflicts can occur but there's no UI to resolve them yet.
3. **Error Messages**: Error handling is basic and needs improvement across all git operations.

## üìù Notes

- **Agent Work Recovery**: Successfully recovered index.html from .mem-git shadow repository after agents deleted it
- **File Restoration**: Restored 11 files from .mem-git to undo problematic agent changes
- **Commit**: All work committed as "2nd Release: Swam IDE v0.1.5-beta" (commit 9db28b5)
- **Architecture**: Git features are well-architected with clean separation between UI (components), services, and backend (lib/git)

## üéØ Next Steps (Recommended Order)

1. **Fix Push/Pull** - Debug and fix the broken push/pull operations (CRITICAL)
2. **Error Handling** - Improve error messages and handling across all operations
3. **Conflict Resolution UI** - Implement basic conflict resolution interface
4. **Push/Pull Indicators** - Add visual indicators in status bar for sync status
5. **Branch Context Menu** - Enhance branch interactions with right-click menu
6. **Stash Support** - Add stash functionality for better workflow
7. **Remote Management** - Add UI for managing remotes
8. **Tag Management** - Add tag creation and management
